## Overview

**The Writer's Lens** is a single-page web application that allows users to interact with a generative AI chatbot that mimics the writing styles of famous authors. Users can choose an author from a wide selection, enter a topic or prompt, and receive creative and style-aligned text generated by Google's Gemini AI. This project combines elements of generative AI, natural language processing, and style transfer to deliver highly customized content based on the works of literary icons.

## Project Highlights

- **Generative AI**: Utilizes Google's Gemini API to generate contextually accurate, stylized responses based on the user's prompt and the chosen author.
- **Customizable Experience**: Users can select from a wide array of famous authors or opt for a custom writer option to further personalize the experience.
- **Style Mimicking**: The chatbot crafts responses that align with each author's unique writing style, offering insights into different literary techniques and creating engaging conversations.

## Idea Behind the App

The core idea of **The Writer's Lens** is to allow users to explore different writing styles through AI. By integrating Google's Gemini API, we can generate text that mimics the idiosyncrasies and nuances of some of the most renowned authors in literature. Whether you're looking for humor in Mark Twain's style, philosophical musings from Dostoevsky, or the dark, atmospheric tone of Edgar Allan Poe, the app offers an immersive experience for literature fans and creative writers alike. It‚Äôs a playful tool to get inspiration, learn about different literary approaches, or simply engage with fun, creative dialogues crafted by AI.

## How Prompting Techniques Were Applied

For each of the authors in our list, a specific prompt engineering technique was used to match the style of that particular writer. By incorporating brief descriptions of the author's style, we prompt Google's Gemini AI model to generate outputs consistent with their unique linguistic features, tone, and themes. 

Some common techniques include:

- **Contextualized Prompts**: The initial input combines both the topic provided by the user and a brief description of the author's style. This ensures the response generated mirrors the expected tone, structure, and vocabulary of the selected author.
- **Role-Playing Technique**: Each time the model generates content, it is instructed to "speak" or "write" in the style of the chosen author (i.e., "You are a writer crafting in the style of Mark Twain").
- **Descriptive Framing**: By framing the response within key descriptive keywords (such as ‚Äúgothic and mysterious‚Äù for Edgar Allan Poe or ‚Äúwitty and romantic‚Äù for Jane Austen), the chatbot adjusts the generative process to stay true to the author's signature traits.

## Parameters Tweaked and Why

The main parameters in this project are:

1. **Temperature**:
   - Controls the creativity of the AI's responses.
   - **Higher temperature values** (e.g., 0.8 to 1.0) generate more diverse and creative responses, which is beneficial for a style-mimicking chatbot.
   - **Lower values** (e.g., 0.2 to 0.4) would make the responses more deterministic, focusing on accuracy and consistency.
   
   For our application, the **temperature** has been adjusted to a medium-high value (around 0.7), giving a balanced mix of creativity and consistency, ensuring that the output is stylistically accurate but still engaging.

2. **Max Length**:
   - Dictates the maximum number of tokens (words or parts of words) in the response.
   - This allows us to control the verbosity of the AI-generated content.
   
   Instead of giving users full manual control over the length, we mapped general descriptive words like "short", "medium", and "long" to specific max token limits. For example:
   - "Short" = 50-100 tokens
   - "Medium" = 100-200 tokens
   - "Long" = 200-300 tokens
   
   These preset limits help keep the application user-friendly while preventing excessively long outputs.

3. **Model Used (Gemini-1.5)**:
   - Google's Gemini API was chosen due to its capability to handle nuanced prompts and generate high-quality, human-like text based on specific writing styles.
   - It allows flexible text generation while maintaining coherence within the stylistic constraints, an important factor for accurately representing literary figures.

## Features

- **Author Selection**: Choose from an extensive list of authors such as Shakespeare, Hemingway, Orwell, and many more.
- **Learning Mode**: Toggle to learn about the literary styles of authors and get deeper insights into their works and techniques.
- **Custom Writer Option**: If the listed authors don't suit your needs, the custom writer option lets you create a description of your preferred writing style.
- **Responsive Design**: The app functions optimally across a wide range of screen sizes.
